# DSA TODO daily study 4 hour
- Big (o) 
- sorting(quick sort,merge sort) and other nlog(n) sorting
- searching(binary search)
- divide and conquer
- recursion
- DP and memoization
- greedy algorithms
- bracktracking
- hashtable
- trees
  - Btree, n-ary trees, trie-trees, red/black, avl tree, splay tree with their implementation
  - You should know about tree traversal algorithms: BFS and DFS, and know the difference between inorder, postorder and preorder.
- graph
  -  breadth-first search and depth-first search. You should know their computational complexity, their tradeoffs, and how to implement them in real code.
  -  Dijkstra 
  -  prim
  -  kruskal
  -  You should especially know about the most famous classes of NP-complete problems, such as traveling salesman and the knapsack problem, and be able to recognize them when an interviewer asks you them in disguise
- arrays
- stack
- queue
- linkedlists
- sets
- maps
- Math
  - combinatorics and probability. You should be familiar with n-choose-k problems and their ilk â€“ the more the better
- OS
  - to know about processes, threads and concurrency issues
  - Know about locks and mutexes and semaphores and monitors and how they work. Know about deadlock and livelock and how to avoid them. Know what resources a processes needs, and a thread needs, and how context switching works, and how it's initiated by the operating system and underlying hardware. Know a little about scheduling. The world is rapidly moving towards multi-core, and you'll be a dinosaur in a real hurry if you don't understand the fundamentals of "modern" (which is to say, "kinda broken") concurrency constructs.
- choose java or javascript for coding
- practice/write code on google docs
